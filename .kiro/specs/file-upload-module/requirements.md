# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The File Upload Module provides a backend API and minimal client UI for uploading files to the EduScale Engine. The system supports two storage modes: Google Cloud Storage (GCS) for production cloud deployments and local disk storage for development environments.

The system implements a dual-path upload strategy based on file size:
- **Small files (≤31 MB)**: Direct upload through Cloud Run API with multipart/form-data
- **Large files (>31 MB)**: Two-step process using GCS signed URLs for direct browser-to-storage upload, bypassing Cloud Run's 32 MB request limit

This approach optimizes for simplicity with small files while enabling efficient large file uploads without proxy overhead or Cloud Run limitations.

## Glossary

- **Upload Record**: A record created when a file is uploaded, containing metadata and storage location information
- **Upload Session**: A pre-created upload context for large files that includes a signed URL and metadata, created before the actual file transfer
- **Storage Backend**: The configured destination for uploaded files, either "gcs" (Google Cloud Storage) or "local" (local filesystem)
- **Signed URL**: A time-limited URL generated by GCS that allows direct browser-to-storage uploads without proxying through the API
- **File ID**: A UUID4 identifier generated for each upload session to uniquely identify files
- **Region ID**: A client-provided identifier indicating the geographic or logical region associated with the uploaded data
- **Upload Store**: An in-memory data structure that tracks completed and pending uploads
- **EduScale Engine**: The FastAPI-based backend service that processes educational data
- **Content Type**: The MIME type of the uploaded file (e.g., "text/csv", "audio/mpeg")
- **Upload Method**: The routing strategy for a file upload, either "direct" (through API) or "signed_url" (direct to GCS)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configure Storage Backend

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the storage backend for file uploads, so that the same codebase can run in both cloud and local development environments.
